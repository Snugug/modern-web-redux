## Doing the Modeling

* Proper domain modeling should happen in tandem with content strategy
* Start with broad strokes: a big brainstorm to outline the overall domain
* Iterate by refining, reducing, and experimenting with prototypes
* Return for more input from clients/experts when things stop making sense
* Rinse and repeat, throughout the project
