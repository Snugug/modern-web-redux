<h2>Designable as Static Images</h2>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Design starts at the <strong>content</strong>, not the page</li>
  <li class="fragment">Pictures fail to provide context and cannot adapt to the large (and growing) number of variables that must be designed for</li>
  <li class="fragment">The "page" is (mostly) irrelevant; it's ever changing. Tying your design to the idea of a page will harm your user experience</li>
</ul>
